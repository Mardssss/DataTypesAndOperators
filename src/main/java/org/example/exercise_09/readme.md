Write a Java program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle given its radius and print the results.
- Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.
- Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: Area = π * r^2, where r is the radius and π is a constant (3.14159).
- Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula: Circumference = 2 * π * r.
- Print the calculated area and circumference.
